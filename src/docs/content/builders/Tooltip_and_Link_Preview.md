## Tooltips

### Functionality
- Tooltips are small, pop-up informational boxes that appear when a user hovers their cursor over or clicks on a specific UI element (e.g., a button, icon, or text link).
- They provide additional context or supplementary information related to the UI element they are associated with.

### Content
- Tooltip content is typically concise and designed to offer quick, contextual information, such as help text, short descriptions, or clarifications.

### Appearance
- Tooltips are usually minimalistic and compact in design, often a small box or bubble containing text.
- They are meant to be unobtrusive and not distract from the main content.

### User Interaction
- Tooltips are usually triggered by user actions like hovering or clicking. They disappear when the user moves their cursor away from the associated UI element.

## Link Previews

### Functionality
- Link previews are a feature that provides a visual representation and summary of an external web page or resource linked within a Melt UI interface.

### Content
- Link previews typically include elements like the title of the linked page, a snippet of text, an image or icon, and sometimes additional information such as the source or publication date.

### Appearance
- Link previews are larger and more visually engaging than tooltips. They often include images, making them suitable for previewing web pages or articles.

### User Interaction
- Link previews are typically generated automatically when a user posts a link, and they are often static. Users can usually click on the link preview to navigate to the linked web page.

## Use Cases
- Tooltips are used for enhancing the user experience by providing supplementary information or guidance within the Melt UI.
- Link previews are used when users share URLs in messages or posts, giving a preview of the linked content, which can be especially useful for social media, chat applications, or content sharing platforms.

## In Summary
Tooltips are small, text-based pop-ups that provide additional information within the Melt UI, while link previews are larger, visually engaging previews of external web content shared within the UI. Each serves a specific purpose and is triggered differently by user actions.
