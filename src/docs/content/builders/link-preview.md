<Callout type="warning">

⚠️ The Link Preview is only intended to be used with a mouse or other pointing device. It doesn't
respond to touch events, and the preview content cannot be accessed via the keyboard. On touch
devices, the link will be followed immediately. As it is not accessible to all users, the preview
should not contain vital information.

</Callout>

## Anatomy

- **Trigger**: The element that opens the link preview on hover.
- **Content**: The element containing the content for the link preview.
- **Arrow**: An optional arrow component

## Usage

Create a link preview using the `createLinkPreview` builder function.

```svelte {3-5}
<script lang="ts">
	import { createLinkPreview, melt } from '@melt-ui/svelte'
	const {
		elements: { trigger, content, arrow }
	} = createLinkPreview()
</script>
```

Then you can use the `trigger`, `content`, and `arrow` to construct a link preview. A high level
example of how to structure the link preview is shown below.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { createLinkPreview, melt } from '@melt-ui/svelte'
	const {
		elements: { trigger, content, arrow }
	} = createLinkPreview()
</script>

<button use:melt={$trigger}>Hover Me</button>

<div use:melt={$content}>
	<div>I am content inside the link preview</div>
	<div use:melt={$arrow} />
</div>
```

It's also possible to use Svelte Transitions, as demonstrated in the example at the top of this
page.

### Focus handling

By default the link preview will be shown when focused by the keyboard (or more specifically if
`:focus-visible` would apply), and hide on blur.

You can disable this functionality by listening to and cancelling the custom `m-focus` and `m-blur`
events.

```svelte {3-8}
<button
	use:melt={$trigger}
	on:m-focus={(e) => {
		e.preventDefault()
	}}
	on:m-blur={(e) => {
		e.preventDefault()
	}}>
	Hover Me
</button>
```

## Accessibility

The link preview is only intended to be used with a mouse or other pointing device and the preview
content cannot be accessed via the keyboard and is not exposed to screen readers. As a result the
preview should not contain content that is otherwise not visible elsewhere.
