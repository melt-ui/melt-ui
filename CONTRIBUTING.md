- Priority is the best User Experience
- Complexity should be introduced when it’s inevitable
- Code should be easy to reason about
- Code should be easy to delete
- Avoid abstracting too early
- Avoid thinking too far in the future

## How to contribute

There are many ways to contribute to the project. Code is just one possible means of contribution.

- **Feedback.** Tell us what we're doing well or where we can improve.
- **Support.** You can answer questions on Discord, or provide solutions for others in
  [open issues](https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui/issues).
- **Write.** If you come up with an interesting example, write about it. Post it to your blog and
  share it with us. We'd love to see what folks in the community build with Melt UI!

## Creating a new component builder?

Awesome! Builders vary quite a lot in complexity, but don't be afraid. It's pretty straight-forward.
What I'd recommend, is to take a look at the existing builders and see how they work. You'll see
that they all follow a similar pattern. I usually copy over an existing builder just to get started.

When creating a new builder, it's usually best to discuss it with us first. You can do so on GitHub,
or on our Discord. This is recommended to see if this builder would be a welcome addition, how it
should be approached, what are the accessibility concerns, etc.

While we have some custom utilities to create our builders, they're mostly self-explanatory. As
always, if you have any doubts, feel free to reach out to us anytime.

## Preparing a Pull Request

A good PR is small, focuses on a single feature or improvement, and clearly communicates the problem
it solves. Try not to include more than one issue in a single PR. It's much easier for us to review
multiple small pull requests than one that is large and unwieldy.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

2. Clone the fork to your local machine and add upstream remote:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your username>/melt-ui.git
cd melt-ui
git remote add upstream https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui.git
```

1. Synchronize your local `develop` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
```

1. Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```sh
pnpm i
```

1. Create a new branch related to your PR:

```sh
git checkout -b fix/bug-being-fixed
```

6. Make changes, then commit and push to your forked repository:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

7. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/melt-ui/melt-ui) and
   [make a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

8. We will review your Pull Request and either merge it, request changes to it, or close it with an
   explanation.

## Working locally

### Development

```bash
# install dependencies
pnpm i

# start docs page and see examples in the browser
pnpm run dev
```

Make your changes and check that they resolve the problem with an example in the local docs. We also
suggest adding tests to support your change, and then run `pnpm run test` to make sure nothing is
broken.

Lastly, run `pnpm run lint` && `pnpm run check` to ensure that everything is in order before
submitting the pull request.
