   Radix Svelte
</h1>

## Description

This is a port of [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for Svelte.

### Design Principles

This is not a 1:1 re-implementation of Radix UI. The goal is to provide a similar API and experience, but with a few differences:

- Two-way binding is used instead of event handlers.
- No `asChild` prop (for now).
